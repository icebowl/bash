Raspberry Pi Bash

RPi Linux specific command:
sudo rasppi-config
vcgencmd measure_temp  : reveals the CPU temperature (vital if you're concerned about airflow).
vcgencmd get_mem arm && vcgencmd get_mem gpu  : will reveal the memory split between the CPU and GPU, which can be adjusted in the config screen.


List of useful RPi and Linux BASH commands.
sudo -i :  This is my favorite way to become a super user
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo rpi-update
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade && sudo rpi-update

pwd : shows you the current directory (print working directory).
ls :  will list the contents of the directory.
cd : is used to change the directory. For example, cd edward with switch you to a child directory called "Edward" while cd.. returns focus to the parent directory.
mkdir newdir : will create a new directory, where "newdir" is the directory label. You can also create a succession of new directories with mkdir -p /home/edward/newdir1/newdir2, where both newdir1 and newdir2 are created, but this will only work with the -p
clear : presents a clean new screen, useful if your previous commands are cluttering things up.

cat /proc/cpuinfo  
cat /proc/meminfo displays details about the Raspberry Pi's memory.
cat /proc/partitions reveals the size and number of partitions on your SD card or HDD.
cat /proc/version shows you which version of the Pi you are using.

free -o -h will display the available system memory.
top d1 checks the load on your CPU, displaying details for all cores.
df -h is a great way to quickly check the free disk space on your Raspberry Pi.

ls /dev/sda* displays a list of partitions on the SD card. For a Raspberry Pi with a HDD attached, substitute sda* with hda*.
lsusb displays all attached USB devices. This is crucial for connecting a hard disk drive or other USB hardware that requires configuration.

startx will start the Raspberry Pi GUI (graphic user environment) and return you to the default Raspbian desktop.
sudo shutdown -h now will commence the shutdown process with immediate effect. Schedule a timed shutdown with the format: sudo shutdown -h 21:55
sudo reboot is for restarting the Raspberry Pi from the command line.
